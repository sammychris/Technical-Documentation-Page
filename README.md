# Technical-Documentation-Page
This is a Javascript Documentation Page built by me while learning with freeCodeCamp.
It has been an awesome experience for me, building well design and responsive web pages while learning with FCC.
The design is similar to that of FCC Js-Techinical-Documentation-page, which is amazing.
You can check it out on github url https://sammychris.github.io/Technical-Documentation-Page/
You can also check it on codepen and other works of mine https://codepen.io/SammyChris/full/JzLbyZ
